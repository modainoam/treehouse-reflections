Class 1 - Getting Started
  #git init - initialize empty repo
    *optionally 'git init folder_name' -> creates folder

  the ".git" folder is hidden, but it contains all of the repo data all the history and commits and everything is there

Class 2 - committing files
  # git add myfile.txt -> add file to staging
  # git commit -> opens commit dialogue and commits
  # git commit -a -m "fix bug" -> -a = add all changed files(no need for add). -m = commit message. -a only adds currently tracked files

Class 3 - Staging Area
  The staging area includes all the files that were added but not commited.
  # git status -> shows current branch and commit status

Class 4 - Looking Back
  # git log -> lets you look at all you past commits.
  # git checkout commit_id -> lets you use an old version.
    * 4-5 first digits of id should suffice
    * to go back to normal, use checkout master
    * HEAD~1 -> stands for the previous commited version(not the last one)

Class 5 - Branches
  # git branch branch_name -> creates a new branch(does not checkout said branch)
  # git checkout branch_name -> checkout branch
  # git checkout -b branch_new -> checkouts and creates a new branch if it doesn't exist
  * When yoiu create a new branch, it splits from your current position in your current branch, meaning if I am in branch_1 and I create a new branch_2, branch_2 will have all the commits of branch_1 and therefore may not be up to date with "master"
  # git branch -> lists all existing branches and shows current branch
  # git branch -D useless_branch -> deletes branch
