Class 1 - Getting Started
  #git init - initialize empty repo
    *optionally 'git init folder_name' -> creates folder

  the ".git" folder is hidden, but it contains all of the repo datam all the history and commits and everything is there

Class 2 - committing files
  # git add myfile.txt -> add file to staging
  # git commit -> opens commit dialogue and commits
  # git commit -a -m "fix bug" -> -a = add all changed files(no need for add). -m = commit message. -a only adds currently tracked files

Class 3 - Staging Area
  The staging area includes all the files that were added but not commited.
  # git status -> shows current branch and commit status

Class 4 - Looking Back
  # git log -> lets you look at all you past commits.
  # git checkout commit_id -> lets you use an old version.
    * 4-5 first digits of id should suffice
    * to go back to normal, use checkout master
