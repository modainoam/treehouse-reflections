    *optionally 'git init folder_name' -> creates folder

  the ".git" folder is hidden, but it contains all of the repo datam all the history and commits and everything is there

Class 2 - committing files
  #git add myfile.txt -> add file to staging
  # git commit -> opens commit dialogue and commits
  # git commit -a -m "fix bug" -> -a = add all changed files(no need for add). -m = commit message
