Media Queries - 
	Class 1-@media Features
		Media FEATURES are the filters you use in @media. The most common one is
		min-width, but there are a bunch of others. One that might be useful is
		ORIENTATION which specifies if the device is in landscape or portrait mode.
		#@media screen only - "screen" specifies that this is not for priniting.
		# a comma(,) in the filter can serve as an OR operator for multiple filters
		to take effect.

	Class 2 -Breakpoints
		A breakpoint is a certain size where the layout doesn't hold any more
		or doesn't look good. This is the threshold where the media query
		will be applied to create a new layout.

	Class 3 - When to use breakpoints?
		A breakpoint should not be used for every type of devices, as this 
		defeats the purpose of responsive web design. 
		Breakpoints should be added when the content requires it, meaning
		when a fix needs to be added or a feature could be added to better present
		the webpage.
		#There could be Minor and Major breakpoints. 
		Not every breakpoints should introduce dramatic changes, some might just
		fix the size of the header, or the position of one column.
		Just be careful not to add too many breakpoint so as not to overcomplicate 
		the code.

Wrapping up -
	
	Class 1 - Common design patterns
		Header Navigation -
			Small Screen - wide stacked buttons (Hamburger)
			Medium - Tabbed buttons side-by-side below headline
			Large - Tabbed buttons and headling on the same line

		Content- 
			Small- One column, scrolling made easy
			Medium - Two columns, better reading
			Large - Three columns

	Class 2 - Flexbox
		Flexbox is another display module for CSS. It allows us to create a container
		which can be either horizontal or vertical and inside which the elements can be
		spread evenly and with specified proportion.
		-display: flex; -> makes the container a flexbox parent, and all children elements flexbox-items
		-flex-direction: row | column -> specifies the positioning of items inside
		-justify-content: center | space-around | ... -> specifies the distibution of free space
		-flex-grow: int -> specifies a unitless prpoortio of the size of the item compared to siblings
