Intorduction to Jquery
	Class 2 -
		# select an HTML element by using jQuery(".class") (or $(".class").
		# You can then run a function on the element by using $('.a').hide();
		# chaining functions is also possible -> $(".a").hide().show("slow");
	Class - DOM
		# Stands for Document Object Model
		# In the past documents were accessed using pure javascript -> document.body
		or getElementsByClass("warning") (no need for the dot)
	Class 4 - Ready
		Putting the JS code at the beginning of the page might be a problem
		because it happens before the page elements have been loaded.
		There are 2 solutions to that problem -
		1. Surround the code with $( document ).ready(myFunc) or $(myFunc)
		2. Preferred! - Put the JS script tags at the end of <body> in the HTML

	# this.attr() -> retrieve attribute
	# jQuery can create HTML elements that are not part
	of the DOM, like this ->
	var $my_div = $("<div class="mydiv"></div>")

	jQuery object.
	# this.text() -> retrieve or change the html text
