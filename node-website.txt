Class 1 - Create server
  The http.createServer function runs a local server that you can access in the browser. The response is rendered using the response.write() function and is stopped from being rendered once the response.end(content) has been sent.
  *setInterval(function, millisecs) -> runs a function every X ms.

Class 2 - Routing
  # EventEmitter.call(this); -> a constructor class that gives event emitting methods. See node website profile.js for more info
  # One way of routing URLs to the server is to use routing functions that filter on the request.url. If every function filters on a different URL, you can simply send the request to all routing functions and they will do the filtering.

Class 3 - Accessing files
  # Accessing file is done using the filesystem module.
  -var fs = require("fs");
  # files can be read either asynchronuously(so that the next line will probably be run before the file is read) using fs.readFile or in blocking sync mode using fs.readFileSync

Class 4 - HTTP
  # content-types - The content type is part of the header sent to the browser by the server. It specifies the type of the file which tells the browser how to render it - it could be plain text, html and much more...
    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
