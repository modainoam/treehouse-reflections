Class 1 - object literals
  object literals can be retrieved in two ways -
  myObject.keyName, myObject["keyName"]

  # methods - simply assign a function to one of the keys.
  myObject = {run: function(){
    console.log("run");
  }}

Class 2 - Constructors
  # Constructor functions are functions that help create new objects, they are usually capitalized and their syntax is as follows -
  function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age
  };

  # they are assigned like this -
    me = new Person("noam", 25);

  # The "new" keyword allows js to understand this refers to the new object

Class 3 - prototyping
  # A class's properties and methods are usually reinstantiated for every new object created. This means is takes a lot of memory and disk space. For a method to only be created once you can define the mehod as a prototype of the class, meaning the method will apply to every instance of the class(although it can be overwritten)

  MyConstructor.prototype.add = function(a,b) {return a+b};
