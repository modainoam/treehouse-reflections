Functions -
	When creating a function, always add "var" before a variable, otherwise it will overwrite the global variable.
	By using var, it is created in the function scope.

Errors -
	Syntax - throw new Error('error message');

This -
  There a 4 ways "this" is instantiated -
  -In function call - Refers to the scope, usually global or window in a browser
  -In object methods call - refers to the object
    var noam {eyes: 2,
              saveEyes: function(){
                console.log("Noam has " + this.eyes + " eyes")
              }
            };
  -Within a constructed object - refers to the instance! not the object
    var person = function(name) {
      this.firstName = name || "noam" -> gives default value of "noam"
    }
    me = new person(noam)
  -Using bind or .call
