Class 1 - Introduction
  # First word is tag
  # everything after first word is text
  # To write multiline text, put pipe at the beginning like this-
    Line 1
    |have a br to put on html multiline
    | Line 3

Class 2 - if
  # Jade supports if clauses and variable declarations. just indent
  and use a hyphen - before declaring a var
  - var cat = "book"
  if cat == "movie"
    p It's a movie
  else
    p it's not a movie

Class 3 - Loops
  # syntax exmple
  ul
    each value , index in ["A Game of Thrones", "A Feast for Crows", "A Clash of Kings"]
      li.book= index + ":" +  value

  # Literal strings are exited using  #{var1}

Class 4 - Includes
  # To include another file simpy run include "filename_no_extension"
  for example if I have a header.jade file I can run -
  html
    include header
  body
    include content-1

Class 5 - Template Inheritance
  # To extend base style with new content you can create a base jade file and extend its blocks as follows -
  base.jade -

  body
    h1.logo Welcome to my site
    block content
      #main-content

  inherit.jade
  extends base

  block content
    .col-1 My first comment
    .col-2 Second Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,

  -When setting the block it does not have to be indented
  -By default, new data overrides the previous data that was in the block. To add to a block data without overriding it simply use the "append"\prepend command
  append data
    - var name = "noam"
    li name

Class 6 - Mixins
  # Mixins allow you to reuse blocks of code and use them with variables

  mixin products(title, img_id, price)
    .product
      .product_wrapper
        img.prod_image(
        src="#{img_id}.jpg"
        )
        .prod_content {
          h2.title #{title}
        }
